## Sync your subtilte üòÅ

unsync subtitles is a very common issue , with some players you can seek subtilte forwark or backward but the problem is when you want to have two
subtitles simuoultaniesly and one of them is not sync usually the easiest way is to find another subtitle which consumes time and energy
but what if you can change the original subtitle file 
for example if you want to make sub-file 1.3seconds faster you can easy navigate your cmd(on windows) or terminal(on linux) to subtitle directory and
do this :

#### Example for 1.3 seconds forward : 



```
$ python3 sub_shift.py House.of.Cards.2013.S01E05.srt 1.3
```
